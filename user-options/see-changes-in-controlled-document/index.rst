See changes in a controlled document
=======================================

This option is available i Omnia 6.12. It's a feature that must be activated and it requires a paid subscription with Draftable.

When the option is activated it's possible to see the changes that has been made in the latest edition of a controlled document, compared to the last edition before that. If there is only one edition of the document, the option is simply not shown.

The option is available in the information window of a document, through the i icon:

Remember that there must be at least two editions of a document for this option to show up, and that it requires a paid subscription with Draftable.
