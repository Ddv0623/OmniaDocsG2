Print a process
=====================================

To print a process, go to the process and click the button. This can be set up in several ways. Here's an example:

.. image:: print-process-button-new.png

You can choose the following:

.. image:: print-process-settings-new.png

+ **All related process steps**: This prints all related process steps, both main processes and subprocesses. If this process is linked to from a main process, that main process will not be printed.
+ **Single process step only**: Select this to just print the step you see.
+ **Language**: (A description will be added soon).
+ **Include process drawing**: By default the process drawing (if any) will be printed. Deselect if you don't want that.

When you have chosen what to print, click PRINT PROCESS.
