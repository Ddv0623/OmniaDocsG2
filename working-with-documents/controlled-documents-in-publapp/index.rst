In Omnia 6.12 and later it's possible to work with controlled documents in a Publishing app. This is what is needed:

1. A publishing layout for this purpose.
2. Document picker categories set upp correctly.
2. Document Management settings set up in the publishing app settings.
3. A menu option for controlled documents in the page menu (publishing app settings).
