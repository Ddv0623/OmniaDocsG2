Process Context block
=======================

You use this block to make sure the Property Process is available on the Properties tab for the page, so the page can be linked to the intended process. If you create a page to display a specific process, this is absolutely necessary so the various blocks will be populated with data from the process.

Just select "Process" for Page Property and your done.

**Note!** On a page where you plan to add a Process Rollup, you can NOT use this block.

In omnia 6.12 and later this block works slightly different, see: :doc:`Process Context block in Omnia 6.12 </blocks/process-context-612/index>`

Layout and Write
*********************
The WRITE Tab is not used here. The LAYOUT tab contains general settings, see: :doc:`General Block Settings </blocks/general-block-settings/index>`
