Dashboard
===========

Here you can build the Dashboard to your needs. You set up the Dashboard much like you would do a page type. Most sections and blocks can be used.

As you would a page type, the first step is to add the layout, using sections. See this page for more information: :doc:`Working with section and blocks </pages/page-types/working-with-sections-and-blocks/index>`

You then add the blocks you need. All available blocks are listed on this page: :doc:`Blocks </blocks/index>`

The Metrics block can be especially useful: :doc:`The Metrics block </blocks/metrics/index>`

You can also edit some of the metrics settings, in Omnia Admin, see: :doc:`Metric settings </admin-settings/tenant-settings/settings/metrics/index>`

For an implementation example, see this page: :doc:`Dashboard implementation example </admin-settings/tenant-settings/dashboard/dashboard-implementation/index>`
