Promoted Search Results
===========================

Based on search feedback, an administrator can create promoted search results in Omnia Admin.

Whenever a user search on any of the keywords of a Promoted Search Result, it will be available here in Advavdes Search:

In Omnia 6.12 and later, promoted search results can also be displayed in Quick Search, see the bottom of the page.

A list of promoted search can be:
